Crawl 

Android Application
******************************

What is it?
************
Crawl is an Android application that allows user to create or generate a bar/food crawl based on their location. The application
utilizes multiple Goodgle APIs including Maps, Places, Directions, Prediction and Geocoding to show the user what establisments
are in their current area and link them together for the user in an efficient route.

---> Currently looking at the beneifts of using Yelp API. May be more efficient for the user once I begin to incorporate a filter
that includes budget, rating, etc.

Why make it?
************
The idea came from the many, many times that I have been forced to entertain out-of-town guests in a large city. Everyone loves
to find something fun spontaneously so why not have a tool that will choose a logical night out based on what is around. Everyone
needs to have fun.

Status
************
Since I am a year out of collefe and my last year has been me adjusting to a new city and a full time job (especially the 9-5 sched)
I wish I could spend more time on this. I do my best and I plan on going full force on it soon (I swear!).

Features
************
Below is a small explanation of what I want these two features to have. These are essentially the ideas behind the features. If 
you would like more insight shoot me a message and I can explain. Always willing to talk if needed. :D
