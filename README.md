Crawl 
Version Rough!

Android Application
******************************

What is it?
************
Crawl is an Android application that allows user to create or generate a bar/food crawl based on their location. The application
utilizes multiple Goodgle APIs including Maps, Places, Directions, Prediction and Geocoding to show the user what establisments
are in their current area and link them together for the user in an efficient route.

---> Currently looking at the beneifts of using Yelp API. May be more efficient for the user once I begin to incorporate a filter that includes budget, rating, etc.

Why make it?
************
The idea came from the many, many times that I have been forced to entertain out-of-town guests in a large city. Everyone loves
to find something fun spontaneously so why not have a tool that will choose a logical night out based on what is around. Also with so much social media around everyone is always preoccupied looking at everyone else. Lets share weekend and late night journeys. Something like this may already exist, but why not make it better? 

Features
************
Below is a small explanation of what I want these two features to have. These are essentially the ideas behind the features. If 
you would like more insight shoot me a message and I can explain. Always willing to talk if needed. :D


  1) Create Your Own Crawl
   -> User will create their own crawl on the go. It will track their crawl throughout the evening (no continuous GPS) and then       they can choose to rate/share it with their friends. This can be used to show what a cool crawl would be in the future.         This will be used a lot more when I incorporate a social aspect to this application.
  
  2) Generate Crawl
    -> User will select a starting point and the application will generate a crawl for them. Filters are in place that will help        the user decide:
        a) What type of extablishments are you crawling to. (Bars vs Restuarants vs Pubs vs Speakeasys vs ...)
        b) How many establishments they visit or How far do you want to travel from starting location?
        c) How much money are you looking to spend on this excursion?
        d) etc. (Again if you want more info, just shoot me a message!)
        
Status
************
Since I am a year out of college and my last year has been me adjusting to a new city (NYC) and a full time job (especially the 9-5 sched). I posted some rough Java files just to keep my portfolio up-to-date on what I am working on. I wish I could spend more time on this, but I do my best and I plan on going full force on it soon (I swear!).
